            <ol>
                <li>In my current role, I had to overcome the issue of Brexit and the impact it had on the business. I thoroughly researched the implications and sourced and implemented a solution within the final 3 months in order to minimise business disruption.</li></br>
                <li>In my last role, I had to deal with a lot of hostility from irate customers aimed both at myself and my colleagues who were younger and less experienced to upfront conflict. This was an opportunity to learn how to stay calm and professional for the benefit of both internal and external stakeholders in a particular scenario.</li></br>
                <li>During education, I found that I had difficulty remaining motivated and instilling discipline to take over where motivation would fail. I learnt that I need high pressure in order to be able to meet expectations, and that could only come from difficult to meet deadlines. It taught me a valuable lesson in planning successfully to be able to work around that.</li></br>
